# CSV_to_Parquet_Program
Windows application that converts files from CSV to Parquet format or Parquet to CSV.

The main points learned with this project were:
* Learn how to create a GUI (Graphic User Interface) using the *tkinter* Python package.
* Learn something about creating a software, the steps, options offered to the user and programming structure.
* Create a Windows application to help people converting their files from CSV to Parquet compressed file format.

Currently, CSV is one of the most popular data files, as it is easily shareable and many Data Analysis programs can read it. Ergo, the CSV file format became very popular. However, the downside is that the format takes a lot of space in disk. As the number of rows start to increase, the file size grows accordingly. When you have more than 10 thousand rows you start to see the difference between CSV file size and Parquet file size - *.parquet was 5 times smaller in a test with a 5GB csv file.*

This program is available Free for Use under the MIT license, meaning it can be used, copied or changed for personal or commercial use. 
I only ask that my name is mentioned in the credit.
